By making the First Capstone project , I have gotten hands-on experience with the application of the basic yet fundamental concepts of Web Dev. we have been taught in class . <br><br>
I have used my knowledge of HTML , CSS , Google search , structured , productive yet meaningful usage of available generative pre-trained transformer tools to build this project . <br><br>
